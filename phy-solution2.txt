Problem 2: Evaluating the diffraction angle for the red light.

Given Datas:
For green light:
wavelength,  λ1 = 530 nm
order, m1 = 3 (third order)
angle, θ1 = 65.0°
For red light:
wavelength,  λ2 = 700 nm
order, m2 = 2 (second order)

we know,
d * sinθ1 = m1 * λ1
d = (m1 * λ1) / sinθ1
d = (3 * 530) / sin(65.0°)
d = 1754.37 nm
 now,
 for red light:
 sinθ2 = (m2 * λ2 ) / d
 sinθ2 = (2 * 700 nm) / 1754.37 nm
 θ2 = 52.94°

So 52.94° will be the second-order bright spot for red light.
